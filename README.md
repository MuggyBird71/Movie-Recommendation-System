## Overview

**Project Title**: Java Movie Recommendation System

**Project Description**: 
This project is a Java-based movie recommendation system that reads movie data from a CSV file and recommends movies to users based on their preferred genres. It supports reading movie information from both local and remote sources, providing flexibility in data management.

**Project Goals**: 
- To develop a Java application that efficiently handles file operations using object-oriented principles.
- To provide personalized movie recommendations to users.
- To demonstrate the use of abstraction, inheritance, and interface implementation in Java.

## Instructions for Build and Use

**Steps to build and/or run the software:**

1. Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.
2. Ensure Java is installed on your system (Java SE 14 or later recommended).
3. Compile the Java files using `javac` or through your IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.).

**Instructions for using the software:**

1. Run the `MovieRecommendationSystem` class.
2. Enter your favorite movie genre when prompted.
3. View the list of recommended movies based on the genre input.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) - Version 14 or higher
* Any IDE that supports Java (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code with Java extension)

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Oracle Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add functionality to write back to the CSV file to update movie records.
* [ ] Implement a GUI to make the application more user-friendly.
* [ ] Enhance the recommendation algorithm to include more factors like movie ratings and viewer feedback.
