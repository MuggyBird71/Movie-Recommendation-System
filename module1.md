# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Dylan Phillips

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 1 

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |

|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

    Write one or more programs in Java that demonstrates some of the following:

    Variables

    Expressions

    Conditionals

    Loops

    Functions

    Classes

    Data structure from Java Collection Framework (such as ArrayList, TreeSet, or HashMap)

    Stretch Challenges (select one):

    Modify your program to read and write to a file.

    Modify your program to demonstrate inheritance using the extends and abstract keywords.

    Modify your program to create an interface and then use it with the implements keyword.

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material? 
    Java—Wikipedia: To get a broad overview of Java's capabilities and history.
    Java Tutorial—W3Schools: For step-by-step tutorials on Java syntax and basic programming concepts.
    Java Reference—Oracle: For in-depth understanding and official documentation.
    Java Collection Frameworks—BeginnersBook: To learn about data structures like ArrayList, TreeSet, or HashMap that could be useful in managing movie data.

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software? 
    Week 1:
    Overview of Java: Use Wikipedia and Oracle’s official site to understand Java’s architecture and capabilities.
    Basic Syntax and Operations: Use W3Schools to practice basic Java syntax, variables, loops, and conditionals.
    Week 2:
    Java Collection Framework: Study ArrayList and HashMap from BeginnersBook to manage collections of movies and user preferences.
    Begin Implementing Basic Functions: Start coding the core functionalities like storing movie data and user inputs.
    Week 3:
    Incorporate Advanced Features: If progressing well, start implementing file reading/writing or extend classes to demonstrate inheritance.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
    Movie Recommendation System: A Java-based application that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. This will involve:
    User Input Handling: To capture user preferences.
    Data Management: Using Java Collection Frameworks to store and manipulate movie data.
    Recommendation Algorithm: To suggest movies based on stored data and user inputs.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
    Days and Times: Tuesday and Thursday evenings from 7 PM to 10 PM, and Saturday mornings from 9 AM to 12 PM.
    Location: Primarily in your home office, with occasional Saturday sessions at the school library.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
    Technical Risk: Challenges in implementing Java Collection Framework effectively or integrating advanced features like file handling.
        Mitigation Plan: Utilize online forums, and seek help from more experienced peers or mentors when needed. Regularly review and test each component before moving on to the next.
    Behavioral Risk: Potential procrastination or loss of motivation halfway through the Sprint.
        Mitigation Plan: Break down tasks into smaller, manageable goals with daily objectives, and reward yourself upon completion of these goals to maintain motivation.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: 

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|

|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|        |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |        |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |        |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |        |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:
